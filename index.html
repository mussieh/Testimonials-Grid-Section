                        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I
                        learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
                        joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                        "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the
                        bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and
                        have heard some people who had an amazing experience
                        here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
                        incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
                        12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
                        life. Since completing the course, I've successfully
                        switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
                        startup."

                        "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line
                        of code. I needed some structure from professionals who
                        can help me learn programming step by step. I was
                        encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who
                        can only say wonderful things about the program. The
                        entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
                        were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
                        assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                        outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
                        way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
                        often referred to it during interviews as an example of
                        my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
                        job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
                        offers. 100% recommend!"
